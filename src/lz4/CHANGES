Removed all the compressed and streaming related functions I could think of.
This is mainly done to reduce the final binary size and reduce the dependency
to calloc/free. Deleting deprecated API and removing LZ4_FORCE_INLINE from
LZ4_decompress_generic slashed the binary size by more than seven times.
As for GCC 12.2.0 with -O2, LZ4 will occupy just 2.2KB.
`cat build/*.map | grep text | grep lz4` to know how much space it takes
