# Copyright notice

All the source code found in this folder is based on [RIC from sotn-decomp](https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/tree/master/src/ric) and it has been modified to create the custom character in this repository. The original source code of RIC has been thoughtfully crafted by the sotn-decomp developers to compile 1:1 with a playable Richter from SOTN. Special thanks to [@bismurphy](https://github.com/bismurphy/), who created the majority of the original source code.
